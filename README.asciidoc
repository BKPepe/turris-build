Simple Turris OS building script
================================

Getting started
---------------

Create an empty directory you want to build Turris OS in, enter that directory
and from it call `compile_fw` script. In most basic use-case, this should be
enough. Be aware - *it will delete all previous content of the current
directory*. You can repeat individual steps of the compilation separately,
check `compile_fw help` for a list of available commands, generic options and
their brief descriptions.

Advanced usage
--------------

Patching
~~~~~~~~

If you need to patch OpenWRT or any of the feeds, put a git formatted patch
into respective subdirectory of patches directory. In patches directory, there
is openwrt directory and directory for each feed we are patching. Inside those
directories, patches are also divided into subdirectories like `to-upstream`,
`wip` or `hack` to somehow distinguish between quality of patches.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default config for OpenWRT is put in `configs` directory either in file
`common` or in a file named after the target board. Those two files gets merged
and will form the final `.config` file. Some parts of `compile_fw` might modify
it further.
