Subject: [PATCH] busybox: enable whois by default

Some users of OpenWrt would like to use whois on their routers without
re-compiling whole busybox. It means that they need to know how to
cross-compile things for OpenWrt, enable it, compile busybox and flash
it on the router. That's can be difficult.

Tool whois can identify who owns a domain and how to get reach owner.
Providing this tool in OpenWrt someone does not need to use websites for
everything. According to config/networking/Config.in, it should take 6.3
kb.
