+Subject: Move deauthentication at AP start to be after beacon configuration
+
+This allows nl80211-based drivers to get the frame out. The old earlier
+location resulted in the driver operation getting rejected before the
+kernel was not ready to transmit the frame in the BSS context of the AP
+interface that has not yet been started.
+
+While getting this broadcast Deauthentication frame transmitted at the
+BSS start is not critical, it is one more chance of getting any
+previously associated station notified of their previous association not
+being valid anymore had they missed previous notifications in cases
+where the AP is stopped and restarted.

+Subject: Ignore Management frames while AP interface is not fully enabled
+
+It is possible for drivers to report received Management frames while AP
+is going through initial setup (e.g., during ACS or DFS CAC). hostapd
+and the driver is not yet ready for actually sending out responses to
+such frames at this point and as such, it is better to explicitly ignore
+such received frames rather than try to process them and have the
+response (e.g., a Probe Response frame) getting dropped by the driver as
+an invalid or getting out with some incorrect information.
